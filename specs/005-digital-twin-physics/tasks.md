# Tasks: Digital Twin Physics Simulation and Humanoid Modeling

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-digital-twin-physics/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Documentation**: `website/docs/`, `website/i18n/` at repository root
- **Components**: `website/src/components/`
- **MDX files**: `website/docs/module-2/` and `website/i18n/ur/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/module-2/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create module-2 directory in website/docs/
- [X] T002 Create module-2 directory in website/i18n/ur/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/

---
## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T003 Verify Action Bar component is available in website/src/components/ActionBar/
- [X] T004 [P] Create week-6.mdx file structure with proper frontmatter and Action Bar import
- [X] T005 [P] Create week-7.mdx file structure with proper frontmatter and Action Bar import

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---
## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Physics Simulation Education (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Create Week 6 content covering Gazebo physics engines (ODE vs Bullet), world properties, and 'Contact' vs 'Friction' parameters with focus on Gazebo setup and plugins (libgazebo_ros_ray_sensor.so)

**Independent Test**: Students can read Week 6 content and understand the differences between ODE and Bullet physics engines, and how to configure simulation parameters for realistic humanoid robot behavior

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T006 [US1] Author 'website/docs/module-2/week-6.mdx' covering Gazebo physics engines (ODE vs Bullet)
- [X] T007 [US1] Add content about world properties in Gazebo in 'website/docs/module-2/week-6.mdx'
- [X] T008 [US1] Add content about 'Contact' vs 'Friction' parameters in 'website/docs/module-2/week-6.mdx'

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---
## Phase 4: User Story 2 - URDF Anatomy and Modeling (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Create Week 7 content covering detailed URDF anatomy—Joints (Revolute/Fixed), Links, and Inertial tags with a complete XML snippet for a '2-DOF Humanoid Leg'

**Independent Test**: Engineers can read Week 7 content and understand URDF components, including how to create a URDF file with proper joint definitions and inertial properties

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T013 [US2] Author 'website/docs/module-2/week-7.mdx' covering URDF Links and their properties
- [X] T014 [US2] Add content about Joint types (Revolute/Fixed) in 'website/docs/module-2/week-7.mdx'

- [X] T019 [US2] Ensure 'website/docs/module-2/week-7.mdx' follows Startup Founder tone and includes Importance of Physical AI insights

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---
## Phase 5: User Story 3 - URDF vs SDF Comparison (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enhance the comparison between URDF and SDF formats for humanoid bipedalism applications

**Independent Test**: Researchers can read the comparison content and understand the trade-offs, delivering knowledge of when to use each format for humanoid applications

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T020 [US3] Enhance URDF vs SDF comparison with humanoid-specific considerations in 'website/docs/module-2/week-7.mdx'
- [X] T021 [US3] Add performance and functionality differences between URDF and SDF for humanoid robots in 'website/docs/module-2/week-7.mdx'
- [X] T022 [US3] Include tooling and ecosystem considerations for humanoid robotics in 'website/docs/module-2/week-7.mdx'

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---
## Phase 6: Localization & Polish

**Purpose**: Urdu localization and cross-cutting concerns

- [X] T023 Task the 'Urdu-Linguist' to translate 'website/docs/module-2/week-6.mdx' to 'website/i18n/ur/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/module-2/week-6.mdx'
- [X] T024 Task the 'Urdu-Linguist' to translate 'website/docs/module-2/week-7.mdx' to 'website/i18n/ur/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/module-2/week-7.mdx'

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Localization & Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---
## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all content creation tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Author 'website/docs/module-2/week-6.mdx' covering Gazebo physics engines (ODE vs Bullet)"
Task: "Add content about world properties in Gazebo in 'website/docs/module-2/week-6.mdx'"
Task: "Add content about 'Contact' vs 'Friction' parameters in 'website/docs/module-2/week-6.mdx'"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
